                <h5 class="fw-bold ">➽ High School Diploma or Equivalent</h5>
                <p class="text-justify py-0 ps-4">
                    This is a basic qualification for entering undergraduate programs. It certifies that you’ve successfully completed your secondary education. If your country has different systems, equivalents like A-levels or the International Baccalaureate might be accepted.   
                </p> 
                <h5 class="fw-bold ">➽ Standardized Test Scores: </h5>
                <p class="text-justify py-0 ps-4">
                    <span class="fw-bold">Undergraduate Programs:</span> <br>
                    SAT or ACT scores are commonly required. These tests assess your math, reading, and writing skills. High scores can enhance your application and might even qualify you for scholarships.<br>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Graduate Programs:</span> <br>
                    GRE or GMAT scores are necessary for various master’s and doctoral programs. These exams evaluate your analytical writing, quantitative reasoning, and verbal skills, essential for advanced studies.

                </p> 
                <h5 class="fw-bold ">➽ English Proficiency Test Scores </h5>
                <p class="text-justify py-0 ps-4">
                    If English isn’t your first language, these tests measure your ability to understand and use English in an academic setting. Universities usually require a minimum TOEFL score of 78 or an equivalent IELTS score. Achieving a higher score can make your application more competitive.
                </p> 
                <h5 class="fw-bold ">➽ Transcripts</h5>
                <p class="text-justify py-0 ps-4">
                    Transcripts are your official academic records from previous schools. They provide detailed information about the courses you’ve taken and your grades. If your transcripts are not in English, you will need to get them translated and certified. 
                </p> 
                <h5 class="fw-bold ">➽ Statement of Purpose(SOP)</h5>
                <p class="text-justify py-0 ps-4">
                    The SOP is a crucial part of your application. It’s a personal essay where you explain your academic and career goals, reasons for choosing the specific university and program, and how this fits into your future plans. Make it compelling and unique to stand out from other applicants.
                </p> 
                <h5 class="fw-bold ">➽ Letters of recommendation</h5>
                <p class="text-justify py-0 ps-4">
                    You will typically need 2-3 letters from teachers, school administrators, or employers. These letters should highlight your strengths, achievements, and potential. They provide an external perspective on your abilities and help the admissions committee understand your fit for the program.
                </p> 
                <h5 class="fw-bold ">➽ Financial Proof</h5>
                <p class="text-justify py-0 ps-4">
                    Universities require proof that you have sufficient funds to cover your tuition and living expenses for the duration of your studies. This can include bank statements, scholarship letters, or sponsorship letters. This requirement ensures that you can support yourself financially while you’re abroad.
