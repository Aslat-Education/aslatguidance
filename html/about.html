            <p class="lead text-center">
                Our journey begins with our founder, Mr. Adhish Lama, who traveled to the United States in January 2015, embarking on the same path many Nepali students take today. 
                With firsthand experience of the challenges faced by international students—adapting to a new education system, understanding work culture, and maintaining F-1 visa status—
                Mr. Lama witnessed the struggles of many Nepali students who lacked proper guidance and preparation for life in the U.S.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-center">
                Leveraging his extensive network in the U.S., Mr. Lama supported countless international students by providing them with proper guidance and actionable advice.
                He helped students navigate academic challenges, adapt to cultural differences, and maintain their F-1 visa status with confidence.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-center">
                At Aslat Guidance Education, we empower aspiring students to turn their dreams into reality. 
                We provide tailored guidance and resources to ensure students are well-prepared to navigate their academic journeys and achieve success in their chosen careers.
